I highly recommend for you to go through the options available in the Style Settings to make the theme fit you just right!

**P.S.** 
Since the background behind the Settings window is blurred by default I recommend you temporarily turn it off to help you see the changes you make without needing to keep going in and out of the Settings window.

1. Just go to the Style Settings tab in Obsidian Settings.
2. Expand the Prism Theme section.
3. Expand the Extras and Tweaks section.

## üîå Plugin Support
Required for the Theme to work correctly and to enable customisation:

[**Style Settings**](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) - _Allows snippet, theme, and plugin CSS files to define a set of configuration options._

Explicitly supported by the theme:
* [**Advanced Tables**](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian) - _Add improved navigation, formatting, and manipulation to markdown tables in Obsidian._

* [**Kanban**](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) - _Create markdown-backed Kanban boards in Obsidian._

* [**Collapse All**](https://github.com/OfficerHalf/obsidian-collapse-all) - _Adds a button to close or open all folders in the File Explorer._ 

(These plugins have been checked to work correctly and might have additional settings in Style Settings)

If you have any issues with the plugins mentioned above or would like another plugin to be supported by the theme [**Submit an Issue**]([https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban](https://github.com/damiankorcz/Obsidian-Prism/issues)) regarding it.


##  üó∫ Roadmap

Planned task in a rough order of priority:
- [ ] General code cleanup and polish of the core Obsidian UI theme.
- [ ] Full commenting of the source code for easier development.
- [ ] Documentation/Frequently Asked Questions section to help guide new theme users.
- [ ] More explicitly supported plugins.
- [ ] Custom-made UI Icons.
- [ ] Mobile support.

See the [**Open Issues**](https://github.com/damiankorcz/Obsidian-Prism/issues) for a full list of proposed features and known issues.


## üõ† Contributing
Currently the theme is being designed for desktop use with mobile planned once the desktop theme is in a good place.
The theme has been tested on Windows 10/11 so there might be some issues on Linux/MacOS.

If you want to provide specific feedback or report an issue please use [**Issues**](https://github.com/damiankorcz/Obsidian-Prism/issues).

Although I don't prohibit pull requests, the theme is quite complex with a lot of intricate details to keep in mind when adding features so unless you have a good understanding of how themes that utilise Style Settings work and familiarised yourself with how this theme is setup, I'd recommend submitting an [**Issues**](https://github.com/damiankorcz/Obsidian-Prism/issues) instead. I'll try my best to stay on top of the most pressing issues/feature requests!

Otherwise you are welcome to contact me through the channels mentioned below to discuss anything regarding the theme.
